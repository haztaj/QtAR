# research/ — detection-methodology experiments

Hypothesis-driven experiments at the Python matcher layer (research-first: methodology
findings > shipping UI — see root CLAUDE.md). GPU work is cached once (decoded phoneme
streams with per-phoneme frame times); the experiment arms run CPU-only and iterate fast.

## segment_ablation.py — what is the right detection unit?

Motivated by two findings (2026-07-06):
- **Negative result:** no per-clip commit-margin policy fixes long-ayah false commits
  (4 policy families swept) — whole-ayah units are information-limited: long shared
  prefixes diverge late.
- Waqf segments (median 8.5 s) put the corpus back in the regime the matcher already
  handles at 97% (`data/build_segments.py`).

Arms, evaluated on **segment-cut test-reciter clips** (spans from
`data/raw/segments/segment_spans.csv`):
- **A — whole-ayah index** (status quo): quantifies mid-ayah failure (a clip from
  segment k>=2 can't match ayah-start references).
- **B — segment index**: trie over 1,029 waqf segments + all unsegmented ayat as
  single units (the realistic replacement index).

Metrics per arm: top-1 unit / parent-ayah accuracy, time-to-detection in **seconds**
(per-phoneme frame times x 0.04), split by segment position (seg 1 = ayah start vs
seg >= 2 = **mid-ayah cold start** — the pause-resume case the live VAD reset needs).

```bash
python research/segment_ablation.py            # decode-cache once, then CPU arms
```

Cache: `data/raw/segments/test_streams.pkl` (gitignored).
